Question: A patient status post implantation of dual chamber permanent pacemaker presents due to atrial lead dislocation. The patient is brought to the operating room to have the previously placed right atrial electrode repositioned. The incision for the old pacemaker implantation site was infiltrated all the way down to the fascia and the incision was opened. The atrial lead was disconnected and the atrial lead was freed up from its cuff. A guidewire was inserted into the atrial lead and the lead was unscrewed and then positioned in the lateral wall of the right atrium. The atrial lead was then resecured to the pectoralis major muscle fascia. What is the appropriate approach value for the repositioning of the atrial lead? 
Answer: Although the pacemaker implantation site where the lead was attached to the generator was visualized directly, the cardiac lead itself was repositioned percutaneously using a guidewire. The heart is the site of the procedure, and the site of the procedure was not exposed as ICD-10-PCS defines “Open approach.” Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 02WA3MZ
