Question: A patient status post multiple eye procedures, who is diagnosed with corneal edema with anterior segment membrane of the right eye, presented for penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction. The anterior chamber was entered with a blade, the corneal wound was completed, a dense membrane was resected from the iris, and the donor tissue was placed to the recipient bed. Adhesions on the iris were also lysed. What are the correct root operations and approach for the penetrating keratoplasty and anterior segment reconstruction? 
Answer: The penetrating keratoplasty with anterior segment reconstruction represents the restorative procedures performed, and is captured with the root operation “Replacement.” The adhesions on the iris required careful and extensive lysis, and represents a separate procedural objective. Assign the following ICD-10PCS codes: 08R8XKZ
