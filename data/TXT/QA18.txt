Question: A two-month-old with intermittent stridor as a result of a vascular ring presents for division of the vascular ring. During surgery, a left posterolateral thoracotomy was done, the ligamentum was isolated, and then divided between two silk ties. The ends appeared to spring apart with no other fibrous structures constricting the esophagus. The descending aorta was then approximated to the prevertebral fascia using a single Prolene suture, thereby lifting it off the underlying esophagus and trachea. How should this procedure be coded? 
Answer: The intent of the procedure is to free up the esophagus and trachea. Assign the following ICD10-PCS codes: 0DN50ZZ
