Question: Can individual Glasgow coma score (GCS) codes be assigned based on documented numeric values rather than the description of the codes (e.g., eyes open to pain, best verbal response, etc.)? When reporting the GCS, can a total score be calculated if only individual scores are documented? 
Answer: Yes, if the providerâ€™s documentation clearly shows that the ratings are specific scores or numeric values for the Glasgow scale, it would be appropriate to report codes from categories R40.21-, R40.22and R40.23-. These codes are used only when the individual score(s) or numeric values are documented within the health record. Do not assign code R40.24-, Glasgow coma scale, total score, if the individual scores are documented. Assign code R40.24-, Glasgow coma scale, total score, when only the total score is documented in the medical record and not the individual score(s). The 7th character indicates when the scale was recorded. The 7th character should match for all three codes.
