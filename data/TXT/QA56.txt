Question: When a Rh negative mother delivers at term without complication, and she is administered Rhogam prophylactically during the admission, would code Z31.82, Encounter for Rh incompatibility status, be assigned or is code O36.093-, Maternal care for other rhesus isoimmunization, third trimester more appropriate? 
Answer: Assign code O26.893, Other specified pregnancy related conditions, third trimester, along with other codes to represent the delivery. Code Z67.91, Unspecified blood type, Rh negative, may be assigned as an additional diagnosis, if the blood type is not known. If the blood type is known, a more specific code from category Z67 can be assigned. Codes in category O36, Maternal care for rhesus isoimmunization, are not appropriate since the patient does not have isoimmunization. Prophylaxis is being given to prevent isoimmunization. Additionally, code Z31.82, Encounter for Rh incompatibility status, is not appropriate, as according to the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, this code may only be reported as the principal or first-listed diagnosis.
