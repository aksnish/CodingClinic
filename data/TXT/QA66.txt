Question: A patient presents for transurethral treatment of a calculus of the left renal pelvis via ureteroscopy. The endoscope was inserted, the stone was initially fragmented by laser lithotripsy, and some of the remaining fragments were removed endoscopically by basket via the bladder. What is the appropriate body part value as well as the root operation, fragmentation or extirpation? 
Answer: Fragmentation would not be coded separately since it is inherent to the extirpation. The removal of solid matter such as a calculus or other abnormal physiological byproduct from a body part is coded to the root operation “Extirpation,” and includes any previous fragmentation of the solid matter prior to its removal. ICD-10-PCS’ index to procedures under the term “lithotripsy, with removal of fragments” instructs “see Extirpation.” Extirpation represents a range of procedures where the body part itself is not the focus of the procedure. Instead, the objective is to remove solid material such as a foreign body, thrombus, or calculus from the body part. The code selection of the body part value is based on the location of the stone at the beginning of the procedure. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for the fragmentation and removal of the stone from the left renal pelvis: 0TC48ZZ
