Question: A newborn is diagnosed with congenital hyperbilirubinemia, likely hemolytic. A positive Coombs test is also documented. What is the correct code assignment for the newborn? 
Answer: This appears to be a documentation issue. It is the physicianâ€™s responsibility to interpret test results and document his or her clinical conclusions. Therefore, query the physician as to whether the newborn has transient newborn hyperbilirubinemia or congenital hyperbilirubinemia. Assign code P59.9, Neonatal jaundice, unspecified, if the provider confirms transient newborn hyperbilirubinemia.
