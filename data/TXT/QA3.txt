Question: In terms of coding excisional debridement, does dissection mean the same as excisional? For example, the provider’s documentation states: “The debridement was sharp using knife dissection.” 
Answer: No, knife dissection is not sufficient language to be able to code the root operation “Excision.” Knife dissection may only be referring to the means used to reach the procedure site, and doesn’t necessarily say what was done at the site. Query the physician for more information when the documentation only states knife dissection. Use of a sharp instrument does not always indicate that an excisional debridement was performed. A code is assigned for excisional debridement when the provider documents “excisional debridement,” and/or the documentation meets the root operation definition of “excision” (cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part). Documentation of excisional debridement should be specific regarding the type of debridement. If the documentation is not clear or if there is any question about the procedure, the provider should be queried for clarification.
