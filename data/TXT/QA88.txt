Question: A patient with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye underwent pars plana vitrectomy revision. After the revision, Kenalog was injected intravitreally, followed by subconjunctival injections of Ancef, Decadron, and Tobramycin. Is it appropriate to assign additional codes for the intravitreal and subconjunctival injections? 
Answer: No, it would not be appropriate to assign additional codes for the injections. Substances injected during an operative procedure are typically not coded separately. Therefore, ICD-10-PCS codes are not assigned in most cases for the injection of substances administered as part of a more definitive surgery, since they are integral to the procedure.
