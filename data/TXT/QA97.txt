Question: The patient has an open abdomen (abdominal compartment syndrome) and comes in for an exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, and initiation of dialysate infusion of abdomen. After these procedures are performed, Ioban™ (an antimicrobial surgical incise drape) is used to temporarily cover the organs until the abdomen can be closed. Is the Ioban™ coded as a “supplement” of the abdominal wall? 
Answer: Do not assign a code for the placement of the Ioban™. The Ioban™ was placed to provide a barrier to prevent bacteria from entering the surgical site. It was not used as a supplement of the abdominal wall.
