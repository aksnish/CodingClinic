Question: A patient with right foot ulceration, status post partial 5th ray amputation, was seen in the operating room for secondary closure of the right foot. The site of the partial ray amputation was debrided, the wound was closed, and Ovation速 was injected into the subcutaneous tissue in the area surrounding the wound. What is the appropriate 6th character/ substance for the injection of the Ovation速? 
Answer: Do not code the injection of Ovation速 into the wound. A substance injected during an operative procedure is typically not separately coded, as it is integral to the procedure. Ovation速 is an extracellular matrix that provides cellular adhesion and migration and protection of growth factors for wound healing.
