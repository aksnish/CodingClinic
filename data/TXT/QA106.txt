Question: When does one start counting the duration of mechanical ventilation for a patient who is intubated and begun on mechanical ventilation in the emergency department and is later admitted to the same hospital? 
Answer: Begin counting the duration of mechanical ventilation at the time the patient is intubated in the emergency department, if the patient is subsequently admitted to the same hospital. In that situation code both the mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation. However, if a patient is intubated and begun on mechanical ventilation in the emergency department of a hospital and is then transferred to a second hospital for admission, you would begin counting the duration of mechanical ventilation for the second hospital at the time of the admission. When the patient is transferred from Hospital A to Hospital B, already intubated, assign a code only for the mechanical ventilation.
