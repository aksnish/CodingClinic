Question: A patient had one long mid-to-distal lesion in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, which was treated percutaneously with two drug-eluting stents. What is the appropriate body part value for coronary artery sites(s)? Is this considered one or two coronary artery sites? 
Answer: Assign code 027034Z, Dilation of coronary artery, one site with drug-eluting intraluminal device, percutaneous approach. This is considered one coronary artery site (LAD). Multiple stents used to treat a single coronary artery lesion are identified with the device value intraluminal device or drug-eluting intraluminal device, when multiple stents classified to the same device value are used to treat a single coronary artery lesion, that information is not currently captured in the ICD-10-PCS code.
