Question: A patient with left thumb osteoarthritis at the left carpometacarpal and scaphotrapezoid-trapezial joints is admitted for trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty with internal fixation. During the procedure, the entire trapezium was removed; the abductor pollicis longus tendon was harvested from the forearm and secured to the second metacarpal and the flexor carpi radialis. Are separate codes assigned for the trapeziectomy and harvesting of the tendon? 
Answer: In addition to a code for the arthroplasty, separate codes are assigned for the resection of the trapezium and the excision of the abductor pollicis longus tendon that was used as the tissue supplement for the arthroplasty. For the procedures performed assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 0PTN0ZZ
