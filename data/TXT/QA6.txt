Question: In the discharge summary the physician describes the patient’s debridement: “The patient underwent a digressive debridement by physical therapy of her sacral decubitus with pulse lavage and wet-to-dry dressing changes...” Should this procedure be coded as an excisional debridement or a nonexcisional debridement? 
Answer: Assign code 0HD6XZZ, Extraction of back skin, external approach, for the procedure performed. The pulsed lavage digressive debridement is considered nonsurgical mechanical debridement. It does not involve cutting away or excising devitalized tissue. In pulsed lavage, an irrigating solution (or irrigant) is delivered under pressure along with suction. Pulsed lavage is used for the debridement of bone and tissue for wound cleansing in order to remove infectious agents and debris. This method of wound cleansing is also known as “mechanical lavage,” “pulsatile lavage,” “mechanical irrigation,” and “highpressure irrigation.” This type of debridement is coded as nonexcisional debridement with the root operation “Extraction.” The instrument used in the debridement extracts loose tissue, and involves more than simple irrigation. Therefore the correct root operation is “Extraction” rather than “Irrigation.”
