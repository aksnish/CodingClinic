Question: In Coding Clinic, Fourth Quarter 2013, pages 116117, information was published about the device character for the insertion of a totally implantable central venous access device (port-a-cath). Although we agree with the device value, the approach value is inaccurate. The approach value for placement of a port-a-cath should be “Open.” Furthermore, a port-a-cath is a two-part device, and requires two ICD-10-PCS codes, for the insertions of the catheter as well as the infusion device. We are asking that the Coding Clinic Editorial Advisory Board (EAB) revisit this advice. 
Answer: Yes, you are correct. In the published example, a subcutaneous pocket was created under direct visualization in order to place the vascular access port, and therefore the approach is “open” for that portion of the procedure. In addition, a totally implantable central venous access device is a twopart device; therefore two ICD-10-PCS codes are required to capture insertion of the device. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for placement of this type of venous access device: 02HV33Z
