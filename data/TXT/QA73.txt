Question: A patient was seen for total thyroidectomy. Following the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, an endotracheal tube with leads was placed between the vocal folds for neuromonitoring. What is the correct ICD-10-PCS code for intraoperative EMG monitoring via endotracheal tube? There does not appear to be an approach value for natural or artificial opening in the ICD-10-PCS table. 
Answer: In terms of nervous system monitoring, the ICD-10PCS does not provide a specific approach value for natural or artificial opening. The external approach is the closest available equivalent. Reporting intraoperative EMG monitoring is not required. Facilities that wish to collect this information may assign the following ICD-10-PCS procedure code: 4A11X4G
