Question: A patient presents with left frozen shoulder with subacromial impingement, biceps tendonitis, and rotator cuff tendonitis. He underwent left shoulder manipulation, arthroscopic subacromial decompression, biceps tenotomy, and rotator cuff debridement. What are the appropriate ICD-10-PCS procedure codes? 
Answer: The objective of the surgery is to release the shoulder. The root operation “Release” involves cutting and separating, and freeing a body part from constraint to accomplish the objective of the procedure. Shoulder decompression procedures typically include minor shaving or debridement of the articular surfaces of the joint, performed in order to free up the joint. This is considered integral to the Release procedure and is not coded separately. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for the arthroscopic release of the shoulder and biceps tendon: 0RNK4ZZ
