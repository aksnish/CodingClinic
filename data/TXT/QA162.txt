Question: The patient was taken to the operating room post vaginal delivery for control of bleeding using a Bakri balloon. We are unsure if the Bakri balloon is coded to the Obstetrics section or the Medical and Surgical Section. If coded to Medical and Surgical, what are the appropriate body part and approach characters? 
Answer: The root operation “Control” is used since the intent of the procedure is to stop postprocedural (delivery) bleeding. The root operation “Control” is only available in the general anatomic regions, and in this case “genitourinary tract” is the appropriate general anatomic region. For control of vaginal bleeding using the Bakri balloon assign the following ICD10-PCS code: 0W3R7ZZ
