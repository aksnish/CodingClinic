Question: An 84-year-old patient was admitted to our longterm care hospital (LTCH) for posttraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma. She was treated medically at an acute care facility and was then transferred to our facility for continuation of the same treatment she had been receiving at the acute care facility. What is the appropriate 7th character for this encounter? 
Answer: Assign codes S06.5X0A, Traumatic subdural hemorrhage without loss of consciousness, initial encounter, and S06.6X0A, Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage without loss of consciousness, initial encounter, for the subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although the patient was treated at the previous facility, the patient was transferred for continuation of active treatment.
