Question: The patient presented to the hospital for treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage and communicating hydrocephalus, and underwent placement of right frontal ventriculostomy catheter. Since the burr hole was created in order to place the catheter, in ICD-10-PCS would this be coded as an “open” or “percutaneous” approach? 
Answer: As previously stated, the correct approach is “percutaneous.” The ICD-10-PCS defines “percutaneous” as entry, by puncture or minor incision, of instrumentation through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to reach the site of the procedure. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for placement of the ventriculostomy catheter: 009630Z
