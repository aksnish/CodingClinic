Question: A patient with history of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair has developed an extension in the perivisceral aorta. Bilateral renal artery bypass was performed due to the nature of the disease and location of the renal arteries. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed between the right renal artery and the gastroduodenal artery (a branch of the hepatic artery), and between the left renal artery and the splenic artery. How is this procedure coded? 
Answer: The Body Part Key of ICD-10-PCS indicates “hepatic artery” should be used for “gastroduodenal artery,” but ICD-10-PCS does not provide a specific body part value for hepatic artery in table 041, Bypass Lower Arteries. The Abdominal Aorta body part value is the closest available (“upstream”) equivalent. For the procedures performed, assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 04100Z3
