Question: A patient with angina was seen for percutaneous coronary intervention. The procedure was aborted after several unsuccessful attempts to cross an occlusion at the right coronary artery. The coronary vessel was not dilated. How should the procedure be coded? 
Answer: Per the ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting for discontinued procedures B3.3, “If a procedure is discontinued before any other root operation is performed, code the root operation Inspection for the body part or anatomical region inspected.” The correct body part value is “Heart” rather than “Great Vessels,” because the coronary arteries are the arteries that supply the heart muscle. The great vessels are the large arteries and veins that attach to the atria and ventricles of the heart. In this case, “dilation” is not coded, since it was not performed. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 02JA3ZZ
