Question: A patient desiring permanent sterilization was brought to the operating room. The abdomen was entered through infraumbilical incision. A segment of the right fallopian tube was ligated and excised. A segment of the left fallopian tube was suture ligated and excised. What is/are the correct root operation(s) for this procedure? 
Answer: There are several distinct procedures performed on the fallopian tubes for sterilization, including ligation alone, fulguration, and ligation followed by excision. These are coded to the root operations “Occlusion, Destruction, and Excision” respectively. In this case, excision is the definitive procedure performed after the ends of each tube are ligated. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 0UB70ZZ
