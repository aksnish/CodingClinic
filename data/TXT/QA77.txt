Question: When assigning the ICD-10-CM code for heart failure, based on the Index, only code I50.9, Heart failure, unspecified, is reported. There are no instructions in the Index or Tabular at category I50, Heart failure, to assign code J91.8, Pleural effusion in other conditions classified elsewhere. However there is an Excludes2 note at category J91, for pleural effusion in heart failure (I50) that indicates a code may be assigned. Coding Clinic has previously advised that pleural effusion in congestive heart failure (CHF) is ordinarily minimal and not specifically addressed other than by more aggressive treatment of the underlying CHF. Is it appropriate to assign code J91.8, for pleural effusion due to CHF? How is pleural effusion in congestive heart failure coded? 
Answer: Code J91.8, Pleural effusion in other conditions classified elsewhere, is assigned as a secondary code only if the condition is specifically evaluated or treated. Pleural effusion is commonly seen with congestive heart failure with or without pulmonary edema. Ordinarily the pleural effusion is minimal and is not specifically addressed other than by more aggressive treatment of the underlying congestive heart failure. In this situation it should not be coded. However, it is acceptable to report pleural effusion (J91.8) as an additional diagnosis if the condition requires either therapeutic intervention or diagnostic testing.
