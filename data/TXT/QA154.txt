Question: A 59-year-old female, status post laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is diagnosed with gastrojejunostomy stricture. The patient presents for esophagogastroduodenoscopy and dilation. The gastrojejunostomy anastomosis was extremely tight and almost completely occluded. A dilating balloon was able to be passed through the anastomosis. After the stricture was dilated, the scope was easily passed into the afferent and efferent limbs of the jejunum without difficulty. What is the correct body part for the dilation of the gastrojejunostomy stricture? 
Answer: Since the dilation procedure involved both sides of the anastomosi (stomach and jejunum were both dilated), codes are assigned for each site. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes: 0D768ZZ
