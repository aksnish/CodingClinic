Question: When a right colectomy is performed with side-toside functional end-to-end anastomosis, is it appropriate to report an additional code for the side-toside anastomosis? 
Answer: Do not assign a code for the side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis. ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, Section B3.1b, clarifies that procedural steps necessary to close the operative site, including anastomosis of a tubular body part, are not coded separately. This guideline would apply regardless of whether the procedure is an end-to-end or a side-to-side anastomosis. Additionally, since there is a body part for right colon and the entire right colon was removed, the primary procedure is coded as resection. For the right colectomy, assign the following ICD-10-PCS procedure code: 0DTF0ZZ
