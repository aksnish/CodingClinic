Question: A patient is undergoing right uterine artery embolization due to concern for placenta accreta. The catheter was placed in the right internal iliac artery and the uterine artery was embolized using Gelfoam. Is Gelfoam considered a device? 
Answer: Gelfoam is used intraluminally to embolize the uterine artery, and is typically cut into pledgets, inserted in a syringe, and injected into the vessel to occlude it.
