Question: Surgical treatment is provided in the Official Coding Guidelines as an example of active treatment for the selection of the 7th character for initial encounter for codes in Chapter 19. If a patient is admitted to a hospital with nonunion of a previously repaired fracture requiring removal of fixation device and now partial joint replacement, would this be considered a subsequent encounter or would surgery always be considered active treatment, and therefore assigned 7th character “A” initial encounter? 
Answer: Assign the 7th character of subsequent care with nonunion (K, M, N), if provider documentation indicates nonunion in a patient that is status postsurgical treatment, and the patient is now receiving additional surgical treatment. This is consistent with the guidelines for initial versus subsequent encounter for fractures. The Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-10-CM section I.C.19.c.1 state: “Care of complications of fractures, such as malunion and nonunion, should be reported with the appropriate 7th character for subsequent care with nonunion (K, M, N,) or subsequent care with malunion (P, Q, R). Report the 7th character “A” initial encounter, for patients that delayed seeking treatment for the malunion/nonunion.
