Question: The patient was diagnosed with a synovial sarcoma stage III chest mass during pregnancy, and treatment was started at that time. The patient is two weeks post-delivery, and is now being admitted for her third cycle of chemotherapy. What codes should be assigned? 
Answer: Assign code Z51.11, Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy, as principal diagnosis. Assign codes O9A.13, Malignant neoplasm complicating the puerperium, and C49.3, Malignant neoplasm of connective and soft tissue of thorax, for the sarcoma that was diagnosed during pregnancy. It is the providerâ€™s responsibility to state that the condition being treated is not affecting the pregnancy. Unless the provider documents that the pregnancy is incidental to the encounter, the chapter 15 code is assigned for the condition occurring during pregnancy. In this example, the postpartum code is appropriate. Chapter 15 codes may also be used to describe pregnancy-related complications after the peripartum or postpartum period if the provider documents that a condition is pregnancy related.
