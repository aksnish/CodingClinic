Question: A patient with history of endocarditis is admitted with severe acute meningitis causing respiratory decompensation. The procedures performed during the inpatient stay are diagnostic lumbar puncture and mechanical ventilation. No causative organism for the meningitis is found, and the patient is extubated after 36 hours of mechanical ventilation. Which of the two procedures is the principal procedure, diagnostic lumbar puncture or mechanical ventilation? 
Answer: Assign the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code for the lumbar puncture as principal procedure. The mechanical ventilation code would be sequenced as an additional procedure. The ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, Selection of Principal Procedure state, “A diagnostic procedure was performed for the principal diagnosis and a procedure is performed for definitive treatment of a secondary diagnosis: Sequence diagnostic procedure as principal procedure, since the procedure most related to the principal diagnosis takes precedence.” In this case, the lumbar puncture is the diagnostic procedure performed for the principal diagnosis of severe acute meningitis.
