Question: A patient with median arcuate ligament syndrome underwent bypass graft from the distal descending thoracic aorta to the celiac artery with Dacron® graft. What is the correct qualifier for this procedure? 
Answer: According to the operative report, a bypass was not performed. Although the surgeon referred to the procedure as a ‘bypass,’ the route of passage was not modified. The surgeon used the term ‘bypass graft,’ to refer to the device he used. At surgery, he released the celiac artery, and excised the diseased portion of the artery and replaced it with a Dacron® graft. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes: 04N10ZZ
