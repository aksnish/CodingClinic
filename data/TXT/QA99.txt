Question: A patient with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax presents for right talc pleurodesis via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A right-sided thoracoscopy was performed, and followed by placement of an additional port with injection of talc within the right chest. How should this procedure be coded? What is the appropriate approach value? 
Answer: In this case the chemical agent talc, commonly placed in the pleural cavity during pleurodesis, is being injected and “Introduction” is the correct root operation. The root operation “Destruction” is not appropriate because the pleura itself is not being destroyed. Instead, the talc is injected to cause adhesions to form between the exterior of the pleura and the chest wall in order to seal the abnormal air space (pneumothorax) that has formed. The approach “percutaneous endoscopic” is not available in table 3E0 (Introduction) for the pleural cavity body part, and the closest equivalent is percutaneous approach. Since the endoscopic component of the procedure is not captured by the approach value, also report a code for inspection of the pleura for the thoracoscopy. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the thoracoscopic assisted talc pleurodesis: 3E0L3GC
