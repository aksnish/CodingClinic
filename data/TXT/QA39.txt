Question: A patient diagnosed with right obturator nerve entrapment with sciatic neuropathy was taken to the operating room for neuroplasty of the sciatic nerve and partial denervation of the obturator internus muscle. The patient’s previous incision was utilized and extended. Upon entry, the sciatic nerve, obturator internus nerve, and pudendal nerves were all released. The obturator internus muscle was injected with saline containing botulinum type A, and partial lysis of innervation of the obturator internus muscle was carried out. Seprafilm® was placed as an adhesiolytic agent on all dissected nerve and muscle surfaces. What is the correct approach value for placement of Seprafilm® on the nerve and muscle surfaces? 
Answer: The placement of the adhesion barrier during surgery is not coded separately, because it is a surgical supply, and integral to the definitive procedure. If facilities wish to track the use of adhesion barrier during surgical procedures, the codes are located in table 3E0 and are applied to a limited selection of anatomical regions.
