Question: The patient had a lesion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery that was treated percutaneously with one drug-eluting stent and a lesion in the distal LAD artery that was treated with one non drug-eluting stent. What is the appropriate body part value for coronary artery sites(s)? Are these lesions considered one or two coronary artery sites? 
Answer: Two distinct lesions in the same coronary artery (LAD) were treated. These lesions are considered two coronary sites. In this case, since different types of stents were inserted, two codes with the body part value of one coronary artery site are assigned, to show the type of stent used. Assign code 027034Z, Dilation of coronary artery, one site with drugeluting intraluminal device, percutaneous approach, and code 02703DZ, Dilation of coronary artery, one site with intraluminal device, percutaneous approach.
