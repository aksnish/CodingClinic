Question: A patient presents with bleeding duodenal ulcer and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was carried out. Multiple clips were applied to the vessels to control the multiple hemorrhaging ulcers. Should “control” be assigned for the root operation? What is the appropriate ICD-10-PCS procedure code? 
Answer: The root operation “control” is defined as only applicable for procedures to correct postoperative bleeding, and so it does not apply to this procedure. This procedure is a repair of the duodenum. Most of the body’s organs and tissues are vascular, and they bleed when cut or eroded. Repair of a cut or eroded body part is coded to the body part repaired, rather than to a vascular system body part. In this case, the duodenal ulcers are being repaired via an endoscopic approach, with clips placed on vessels eroded by the ulcers. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 0DQ98ZZ
