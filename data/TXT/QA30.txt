Question: How would an immunocompromised state be coded when the intent of a medication is to treat the underlying disease and not alter the immune state? 
Answer: This situation should be coded as an adverse effect. If a therapeutic substance is correctly prescribed and properly administered, and the patient experiences a side effect or idiosyncratic reaction, ICD-10-CM classifies it as an adverse effect. This is not the same as a drug achieving its intended result, such as the question about an immunocompromised state resulting from administration of an immunosuppressant medication.
