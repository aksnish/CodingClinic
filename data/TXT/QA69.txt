Question: The patient sustained a fall and ruptured the right patellar tendon and the left quadriceps tendon. He had open repair with allograft of right patellar tendon and open repair with allograft of left quadriceps tendon. Is the root operation for these procedures “supplement” or “repair?” 
Answer: The surgical objective is to stabilize the knee in order to restore function. The defects in the patellar and quadriceps tendons are being augmented with allograft. The tendons are not being replaced, so the appropriate root operation is “Supplement.” Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes: 0LUQ0KZ
