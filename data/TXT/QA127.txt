Question: The patient presented with epistaxis and the provider documented that two sutures were placed to surround a small ruptured arterial bleeding vessel of the external right naris. Since the purpose of the suturing is to control the bleeding (arterial), table 03Q, Repair, upper arteries, appears to be the correct table, with “face artery” assigned as the body part (4th character). However, “external” is not an option for the approach (5th character). Code 09QKXZZ Repair nose, external approach, also appears to be an option. What is the most appropriate ICD-10-PCS code assignment for the placement of sutures surrounding a small ruptured arterial bleeding vessel of the external right naris? 
Answer: This procedure is a repair of the nose rather than repair of an artery. Most of the body’s organs and tissues are vascular, and they bleed when cut or eroded. Repair of a cut or eroded body part is coded to that body part, rather than to a vascular system body part. Epistaxis occurs when a vessel within the richly vascular nasal mucosa ruptures. In this case, the epistaxis is being treated via externally placed sutures. Although the procedure was performed to control bleeding, in ICD-10-PCS the root operation “control” is defined as applicable for procedures to correct postoperative bleeding, and so control does not apply to this procedure. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 09QKXZZ
