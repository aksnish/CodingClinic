Question: The patient is a five-year-old with severe juvenile scoliosis. She had previously undergone placement of growing rods and the proximal hooks have become dislodged. She is now being admitted for removal and replacement of proximal hooks and growing rods. During surgery the entire growth rod was removed and a new device was placed. A pedicle hook was placed in the fusion mass on the left and then a down-going laminar hook was placed around the fusion mass superiorly at the T4 level. At the T3 level on the right, a claw construct with an up-going pedicle hook and a down-going laminar hook was placed. The rods were then cut and contoured and replaced first on the left. Eyebolts were placed above the hooks and the hooks were compressed. The same procedure was repeated on the right. Both rods were lengthened approximately a centimeter and the new eye bolts were tightened up and sheared. Intraoperative neuromonitoring was also done during surgery. What are the appropriate ICD-10-CM/PCS diagnosis and procedure codes? 
Answer: Assign code T84.328A, Displacement of other bone devices, implants and grafts, initial encounter, as the principal diagnosis. The dislodgement of the hooks is coded as displacement. Code M41.119, Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis, site unspecified should be assigned as an additional diagnosis. The surgeon removed the old hooks and rods and placed new ones. In this case the root operation “Revision” is not appropriate since the entire device was removed and replaced. Intraoperative monitoring of the nervous system during surgery provides recordings and critical detail, which assists the surgeon in preventing neural insults. If desired, intraoperative monitoring may be coded. The code assignment includes both motor and sensory monitoring. Assign the following ICD10-PCS codes: 0PH404Z
