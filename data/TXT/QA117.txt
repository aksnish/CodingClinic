Question: A premature newborn requires mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome and therapeutic lumbar puncture for relief of intracranial pressure. Which of the two procedures is the principal procedure, mechanical ventilation or therapeutic CSF drainage? 
Answer: In this case, there were no procedures (definitive or non-definitive treatment) related to the principal diagnosis. The Z-code describing live birth is sequenced as the principal diagnosis, and codes for increased intracranial pressure and respiratory distress syndrome are assigned as secondary diagnoses. Both the mechanical ventilation and the therapeutic lumbar puncture were performed for the secondary diagnoses. Select the most significant procedure addressing the secondary diagnoses. When the documentation is unclear regarding which is the most significant, query the physician for clarification. The ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, Selection of Principal Procedure state, “No procedures are performed that are related to principal diagnosis; procedures performed for definitive treatment and diagnostic procedures were performed for secondary diagnosis: Sequence procedure performed for definitive treatment of secondary diagnosis as principal procedure, since there are no procedures (definitive or non-definitive treatment) related to principal diagnosis.”
