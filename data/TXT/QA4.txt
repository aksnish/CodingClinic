Question: Can you clarify what determines that a debridement in ICD-10-PCS is excisional? The progress note states: “I have debrided the abscess cavity, removing necrotic tissue and bone by sharp debridement.” Does the word “excision” need to be present as with ICD-9-CM? 
Answer: Yes, the documentation standard for coding excisional debridement in ICD-10-PCS is the same as it is for ICD-9-CM. As with ICD-9-CM, the words “sharp debridement” are not enough to code the root operation Excision. A code is assigned for excisional debridement when the provider documents “excisional debridement,” and/or the documentation meets the root operation definition of “excision” (cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part).
