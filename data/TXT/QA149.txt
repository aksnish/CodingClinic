Question: A patient diagnosed with ruptured left-sided transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula or malformation (AVM) underwent endovascular Onyx-18 liquid embolization. The provider documented satisfactory obliteration of arteriovenous fistula via the primary feeding pedicle off the distal branch of the left vertebral artery. What is the correct root operation for the injection of Onyx-18 liquid embolic agent? Is the Onyx-18 liquid embolic agent considered a device in ICD-10-PCS? 
Answer: The Onyx-18 was used to totally occlude the AVM between the dural venous sinus and intracranial artery. The Onyx-18 is coded as a device in this case, because it is applied to the operative site as liquid, and solidifies to occlude the lumen of a tubular body part (the AVM). The device value for this use of Onyx-18 is intraluminal device. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 03LG3DZ
