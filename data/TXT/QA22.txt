Question: A patient with metastatic bone cancer of the left hip is admitted to undergo acetabular reconstruction with hip replacement. At surgery the proximal femur was prepared using sequential reamers and broaches to accept the cemented Stryker femoral stem. The acetabulum was prepared and a 60 gap cage was placed and multiple screws were placed for fixation. Bone cement was used to fill the lesion and around the screws and to cement the tripolar acetabular insert. The Stryker femoral stem was also cemented into place. The neural head was impacted into the femur and the hip was carefully reduced. What is/are the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code(s) for acetabular reconstruction and a total hip arthroplasty performed during the same operative episode? 
Answer: Due to the significant bone loss additional support (acetabular reconstruction) was needed in order to support the hip socket prior to the total hip arthroplasty. Two codes are required to fully capture the procedures performed. Assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 0SRB0J9
