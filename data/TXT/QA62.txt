Question: The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the right coronary artery (RCA) with placement of two drug-eluting stents. He also had PTCA of the proximal and mid-portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Three drug-eluting stents overlapping from the proximal to the mid- LAD were inserted. How is this procedure coded? 
Answer: Assign code 027134Z, Dilation of coronary artery, two sites with drug-eluting intraluminal device, percutaneous approach. Two distinct sites were dilated, the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery. Since all of the stents placed were drug-eluting, they can be captured with a single code.
