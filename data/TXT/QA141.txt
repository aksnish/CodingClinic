Question: A patient, who is status post open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) due to left arm fracture, underwent delayed closure of the wound. At surgery, the wound was irrigated down to bone using a pulsatile lavage and delayed primary closure was performed with wide skin clips. What are the correct ICD-10-PCS codes for this surgery? 
Answer: In this case, the deeper part of the wound was closed during the initial surgery. During this episode, the surgeon performed delayed closure of the wound using a skin clip closure system. The skin clip is a device that is applied to the wound externally to close wounds that would normally require stitches. Additionally, no code is assigned for wound irrigation performed prior to wound closure. It is integral to preparing the procedure site for closure. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 0HQEXZZ
