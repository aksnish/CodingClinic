Question: In ICD-10-PCS is endotracheal (ET) intubation coded with mechanical ventilation when the patient receives ventilatory support for surgery? 
Answer: Under normal circumstances, mechanical ventilation that is being used during a surgical procedure is not coded separately, and neither is the endotracheal intubation. If, however, the patient remains on mechanical ventilation for an extended period (several days) postsurgery, the mechanical ventilation should be reported. Even if the postsurgical patient is not extubated within the expected postoperative time frame, and requires extended mechanical ventilatory support, the ET intubation would not be “retroactively” coded.
