Question: This same patient underwent repair of the femoroacetabular impingement and labral tear. An arthroscopy was initiated and an intraportal capsulotomy and synovectomy was performed along with shaving of the femur. The labral refixation was performed by placing two anchors and passing noneverting labral stitches to anatomically reduce, directly opposing the labrum to the prepared rim. What are the appropriate root operations for the left labral refixation and left hip osteoplasty? 
Answer: The labral refixation and osteoplasty were done to restore the structure and function of the hip joint, and therefore, repair is the appropriate root operation. The femoral shaving is coded separately because it is a procedure performed on the femur rather than on the hip joint. The capsulotomy and synovectomy were performed to access the procedure site and are not coded separately. Assign the ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 0SQB4ZZ
