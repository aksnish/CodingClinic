Question: A seven-year-old boy with Noonan syndrome and non-cleft velopharyngeal insufficiency underwent posterior pharyngeal flap to the soft palate. At surgery, the posterior pharyngeal flap was suspended to the soft palate oral mucosa for treatment of non-cleft velopharyngeal insufficiency. The root operation “Transfer” appears to meet the objective of the surgery, since it involves moving without taking out, all or a portion of a body part to another location to take over the function of all or a portion of a body part. What is the appropriate procedure code assignment for the pharyngeal flap to the soft palate? 
Answer: For the posterior pharyngeal flap to the soft palate, assign the ICD-10-PCS code as follows: 0KX40Z2
