Question: A patient with melena presents for upper GI endoscopy. An endoscopy was introduced through the mouth and advanced to the third part of the duodenum. An area of angiodysplasia was found in the gastric fundus which was oozing. This area was successfully injected with epinephrine. Should the injection of epinephrine done during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) be coded? 
Answer: The area of oozing in the gastric fundus was treated by the epinephrine injection. Normally injections are not coded in the inpatient setting, and substances injected during an operative procedure are not coded separately. However, since the only therapeutic part of the procedure is the injection, the injection procedure can be used to indicate that the procedure was more than just a diagnostic endoscopy. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the upper GI endoscopy with epinephrine injection: 0DJ08ZZ
