Question: This patient had a lesion within the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery that extended into a branch artery of the LAD at the bifurcation and two drug-eluting stents were placed percutaneously, one in the LAD and one in the branch. Are branches considered separate coronary artery sites? What is the appropriate number of coronary artery sites? 
Answer: In this case, the branch is not coded as a separate coronary artery site. According to the procedure report, the lesion extended from the LAD to the branch. If the lesion in the branch had been a separate lesion than the one in the LAD, then the body part value would be coded as two coronary sites. Assign code 0270346, Dilation of coronary artery, one site, bifurcation, with drug-eluting intraluminal device, percutaneous approach.
