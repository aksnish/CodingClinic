Question: A patient presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe flank pain. Radiologic studies demonstrated a staghorn stone of the left kidney and a left ureter stone without obstruction or hydronephrosis. The patient was admitted, and underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of the left kidney and left ureter calculi. Stone fragments were removed from both sites endoscopically via basket, and a ureteral stent was placed. What are the appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes? The same patient returned to the hospital one week later. A fragmented portion of the left stone had not passed in urine. It is now in the bladder, causing pain. The bladder stone was fragmented using extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), and was removed endoscopically via basket. How should this be coded? 
Answer: For the first admission, assign code N20.2, Calculus of kidney with calculus of ureter, as the principal diagnosis. Unlike the previous case, where a calculus was moved from one site to another during treatment, here calculi were at two different body sites, and both were treated with extirpation. Therefore both procedure sites are coded. For the first admission, assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the fragmentation and removal of the kidney and ureter calculi with placement of ureteral stent: 0TC18ZZ
