Question: A patient is admitted to undergo removal of 34 uterine fibroids via an open approach. Would it be appropriate to apply the Multiple Procedure Guideline, B3.2b, and report code 0UB90ZZ 34 times? 
Answer: Excision of several fibroid tumors from the uterus is not coded multiple times, because the excisions are not being performed on a separate body part. The phrase “different body sites” in Multiple Procedure Guideline B3.2b refers to distinct body parts, not different locations within the same body part. The example provided with this guideline clarifies the intent of the guideline, as it involves the same procedure being repeated on two anatomic body parts classified to a single ICD-10-PCS body part value (e.g., excision of the sartorius muscle and excision of the gracilis muscle, which are separate and distinct body parts that are both included in the upper leg muscle body part value, and so both procedures are coded). For the excision of multiple uterine fibroids assign only the following ICD-10-PCS code once: 0UB90ZZ
