Question: A patient diagnosed with a head and neck malignancy undergoes wide excision of tongue, bilateral modified neck dissection and tracheostomy. During surgery, he was placed on mechanical ventilation and weaned to a tracheal mask the following day. Oxygen was then delivered via the tracheal mask. What is the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code assignment for oxygen delivered via a tracheal mask? 
Answer: Oxygen delivered via a tracheal mask is not mechanical ventilation. It is a method to provide supplemental oxygen. A tracheostomy tube (T-tube) fits inside the stoma and is secured by a harness to the neck. The T-tube may be used by some patients in need of oxygen therapy. Oxygen can be delivered directly through the tracheostomy via a T-tube or a tracheal mask placed directly to the stoma. Mechanical ventilation delivered via a tracheal tube directly into the stoma would be coded as mechanical ventilation. The administration of oxygen is usually not coded.
