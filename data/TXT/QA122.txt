Question: A 28-week, Rh D-negative pregnant patient with a history of previously delivering an Rh D-positive baby, receives a prophylactic injection of anti-D immune globulin during her prenatal visit. The patient does not have isoimmunization. What is the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code assignment for this visit? 
Answer: Assign code Z34.83, Encounter for supervision of other normal pregnancy, third trimester, to indicate this is a normal pregnancy. Assign also codes Z31.82, Encounter for Rh incompatibility status, and Z3A.28, 28 weeks of gestation of pregnancy. Since the anti-D immune globulin was given as a prophylactic measure and the patient does not have isoimmunization, a code from subcategory O36.01, Maternal care for anti-D [Rh] antibodies, is not appropriate. The use of anti-D immune globulin does not mean the pregnancy is not normal. Rh factor is a protein that can be present on the surface of red blood cells and is passed from the parents to their children. Some individuals are Rh positive; while others do not have the Rh factor and are Rh negative.
