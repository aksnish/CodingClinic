Question: A patient with a known history of pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cor pulmonale presents with new-onset shortness of breath, increasing peripheral edema and severe abdominal distension due to decompensated right heart failure. The patient was treated with aggressive diuresis and oxygen supplementation. The physician listed “right heart failure, decompensated cor pulmonale secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension” in his final diagnostic statement. How should acute cor pulmonale be coded when there is no documentation of pulmonary embolism? 
Answer: Assign code I50.9, Heart failure, unspecified, as the principal diagnosis for the right heart failure. Assign codes I27.81, Cor pulmonale (chronic), I27.2, Other secondary pulmonary hypertension, and J44.9, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified, as additional diagnoses. ICD-10-CM’s Index references code I27.2 under “pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale.” Unfortunately the Index under “pulmonary hypertension with acute cor pulmonale” leads to code I26.09, Other pulmonary embolus with acute cor pulmonale. In this case, code I26.09 is not appropriate since the patient does not have a pulmonary embolism. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the organization responsible for ICD-10-CM, will consider a future C&M proposal to modify the codes describing pulmonary embolism with cor pulmonale.
