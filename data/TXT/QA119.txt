Question: A patient is admitted with sepsis and placed on mechanical ventilation and extubated after 20 hours. The documentation states that the patient’s initial respiratory decompensation is due to the sepsis and that the presumed cause of the sepsis is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Percutaneous drainage of the peritoneal cavity is performed and the fluid is sent for cultures. Which of the two procedures is the principal procedure, mechanical ventilation or paracentesis? 
Answer: Assign the code for the paracentesis as the principal procedure. The mechanical ventilation code is sequenced as an additional procedure. The ICD-10PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, Selection of Principal Procedure state, “A diagnostic procedure was performed for the principal diagnosis and a procedure is performed for definitive treatment of a secondary diagnosis: Sequence diagnostic procedure as principal procedure, since the procedure most related to the principal diagnosis takes precedence.”
