Question: A 65-year-old patient with basal cell carcinoma of the left lower eyelid and cheek along with orbital involvement presents for radical resection of the tumor. During the procedure, orbital exenteration, involving resections of the left eye, orbital bone, ocular muscle and eyelid, is performed. Should the approach for this procedure be considered open or external? 
Answer: For resection of the eye, the approach is external. Other related procedures are coded as open, since the surgeon cut through skin and other tissues to expose the site of the procedure. The appropriate root operation is “Resection,” because the entire soft tissue contents of the orbit, including the eye, eyelid and extraocular muscle were removed. However the entire bony orbit was not completely resected. Assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 08T1XZZ
