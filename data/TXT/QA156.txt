Question: This same patient underwent reconstruction of the perineum immediately following the APR. The resection resulted in a 6x10 centimeter defect, and was repaired using a right fascial sparing two-vessel vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. We are not sure about the appropriate root operation. What is the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code for this reconstructive repair? 
Answer: Because the perineal muscle was resected, a flap closure was carried out. The flap closure meets the definition of the root operation “Transfer,” since the flap was transferred and remained attached to its vascular supply. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for the flap closure: 0KXK0Z6
