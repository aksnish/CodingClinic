Question: The patient had previously undergone open reduction internal fixation of a fracture. Three days post-discharge the patient is readmitted due to pain at the fracture site. An x-ray noted improper alignment of the fracture. The internal fixation pins were revised to provide additional reinforcement to the fracture. Is improper alignment of the fracture synonymous with nonunion? Would this be coded as an initial encounter or subsequent encounter? 
Answer: The patient presented with improper alignment of the fracture. It was not a nonunion of the fracture. This is still active treatment, so assign 7th character “A” initial encounter.
