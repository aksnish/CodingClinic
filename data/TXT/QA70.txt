Question: What is the correct ICD-10-PCS code for bilateral cystourethroscopic Deflux injection to treat vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)? 
Answer: Deflux injection is an endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). During surgery, a bulking agent (i.e., Deflux) is injected into the lining of the bladder where the ureter enters into the bladder. The injected agent breaks down over time, but there is a permanent bulge of tissue which serves as the new valve. The urine can still pass from the ureter into the bladder, but because of the new valve, the urine cannot freely flow back into the ureters. Normally these types of injections are not coded in the inpatient setting, and substances injected during an operative procedure are not coded separately. The objective of the procedure is to restrict an abnormally wide opening, and the correct root operation is “Restriction.” Therefore the Deflux injection is considered part of the procedure, and is not considered a device for coding purposes. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes: 0TV68ZZ
