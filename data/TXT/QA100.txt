Question: A 70-year-old male with first and second degree atrioventricular (AV) blocks as well as right bundle branch block presents for insertion of a leadless pacemaker. A leadless pacemaker was inserted via catheter under fluoroscopic guidance into the right ventricle. The ICD-10-PCS does not provide a value for leadless pacemaker. How should this procedure be coded? 
Answer: The ICD-10-PCS does not provide a specific device value for leadless pacemaker. Intraluminal device is the closest available equivalent. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for this new technology: 02HK3DZ
