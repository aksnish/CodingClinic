Question: A four-year-old child has history of truncus arteriosus repair. He is currently being seen to replace a previously placed pulmonary artery conduit allograft that has become heavily calcified and to treat bilateral pulmonary artery stenosis. Both the left and right pulmonary arteries were spatulated and augmented with a patch of pulmonary allograft. A stent was placed in the right pulmonary artery. A pulmonary allograft was cut and sewn to the confluence of the branch pulmonary arteries. The proximal allograft was sewn into the outflow tract of the right ventricle. Should the pulmonary stent and patch augmentation be coded separately or are they inherent to the right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit replacement? What are the appropriate ICD10-PCS procedure codes for the surgery? 
Answer: The stent placement and patch augmentations are separately coded, since the procedural objectives are distinct from the replacement of the previously placed pulmonary artery conduit allograft. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the surgery: 021K0KP
