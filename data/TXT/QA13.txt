Question: A patient with a chronic subdural hematoma of the right hemisphere underwent drainage via burr hole. The liquefied portion of the hematoma was drained, and a drainage device was left in the subdural space. What is the appropriate approach value for this procedure? How should this surgery be coded in ICD-10-PCS? 
Answer: A burr hole is a small hole that is drilled through the skull to assess a targeted local area. In this case, the correct approach is “percutaneous.” The ICD-10PCS defines “percutaneous” as entry, by puncture or minor incision, of instrumentation through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to reach the site of the procedure. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 009430Z
