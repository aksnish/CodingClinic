Question: How is immunocompromised state due to medication or other cause (e.g., AIDS, cancer) coded? The physician documented in the discharge summary that the “patient has an immunocompromised state, on immunosuppressants.” Is this considered an adverse effect of the medication? Additionally, how is long-term use of an immunosuppressant drug coded? 
Answer: Do not assign a code for an immunocompromised state caused by drug treatment or an underlying disease process, such as AIDS, cancer, etc. When a patient is taking the immunosuppressant medication as prescribed, the intent is to suppress the immune system. Assign code Z79.899, Other long-term (current) drug therapy, to show the long-term use of immunosuppressants. The ICD-10-CM does not provide a specific code to identify these drugs. Immunosuppressants are commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, Crohn’s disease, myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc., and they are also used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients.
