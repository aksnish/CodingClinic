Question: A patient presents for treatment of diabetic vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy of the right eye. The provider documented that a posterior pars plana vitrectomy was done, followed by opening of a subhyaloid hemorrhage covering the entire posterior pole, removal of traction from the paramacular region, and removal of hemorrhage from the posterior pole. However, the instillation of oil or gas was not documented. What is the appropriate root operation for the vitrectomy, when there is no documentation that the vitreous was replaced with oil or gas? 
Answer: Although instillation of oil, air, or fluid was not specifically documented, it is necessary to replace the vitreous with one of these substances. However, do not code the instillation separately as it is inherent to the performance of a vitrectomy. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for the vitrectomy: 08B43ZZ
