Question: The patient was admitted for revision of right hip arthroplasty. The right ceramic head and acetabular liner were replaced due to excessive wear. Is this procedure coded as a revision or replacement? What is the appropriate procedure code assignment? 
Answer: When the components of a replaced joint are removed and new components (i.e., femoral head, acetabular surface, femoral surface, and liner) are inserted, codes are assigned for the placement of new components and for the removal of the old components. The root operation “Replacement” is defined as putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place and/ or function of all or a portion of a body part. Conversely, a revision should be reported when the objective of the procedure is to correct the position or function of a previously placed device, without taking out and putting a whole new device in its place. Examples of revision surgery include re-cementing of a prosthetic joint or adjusting a pacemaker lead. A code for supplement is assigned for placement of the new liner. The liner is placed to physically reinforce the replaced joint; it is not functioning as a replaced body part. Assign the following ICD-10PCS codes for the removal and replacement of the ceramic head and acetabular liner: 0SRR03A
