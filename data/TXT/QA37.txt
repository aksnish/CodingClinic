Question: A patient diagnosed with Moyamoya disease with narrowing and obstruction of the internal carotid artery and leptomeningeal anastomotic vessels underwent right hemispheric pial synangiosis from the superficial temporal artery to the cerebral cortex. At surgery, the scalp was opened, exposing the superficial temporal artery. Two burr holes were placed. The cranium was then positioned higher than its natural anatomic position using plates and screws, to allow sufficient room for the superficial temporal artery cuff. A cuff of the superficial temporal artery was sutured in situ with a cuff of tissue. The artery was then sutured to the cortex of the brain. What is the correct root operation for this surgery? 
Answer: In this procedure, the objective is to reposition the cranium to its normal anatomic position. The superficial temporal artery is relocated to the surface of the brain and laid directly on the cerebral cortex in the expectation that it will eventually grow new arteries and thereby increase blood flow. It is considered “indirect re-vascularization” rather than a direct bypass. The superficial temporal artery is not opened anywhere along its length, and no arterial anastomoses are performed between the superficial temporal artery and any “downstream” artery to provide immediate rerouting of the blood. Therefore the root operation is Reposition rather than Bypass. As for the temporal bone flap, it has been repositioned up and over the intact temporal artery to allow it “entrance and exit” in its new position on the surface of the brain. The bone flap is repositioned in a “proud” position (up higher than it was) using plates in order to allow sufficient room for the superficial temporal artery cuff. For the procedures performed assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 03SS0ZZ
