Question: The patient had severe mitral valve disease and underwent open mitral valve repair involving a wedge resection of P2 (mid portion) of the posterior leaflet with a 32 millimeter Colvin-Galloway (CG) Future Band ring annuloplasty. Is this coded as a supplement or repair? 
Answer: The objective of the annuloplasty ring procedure is to supplement the annulus to restore its proper dimensions. Because a device is used to accomplish this objective, Supplement is the correct root operation. The band can restore, or “remodel” the leaking mitral valve opening (annulus) to a more normal shape. The opening of a normal mitral valve is kidney-shaped, and the rim of the opening is referred to as the annulus. Some diseased mitral valves lose their shape, becoming more circular rather than kidney-shaped. The mitral valve cannot close normally, and blood flows backwards into the left atrium (mitral regurgitation). Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes: 02UG0JZ
