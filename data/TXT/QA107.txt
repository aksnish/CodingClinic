Question: A patient status post tracheostomy was admitted as an inpatient on mechanical ventilation. Five days later the tracheostomy was removed and the patient was successfully weaned off of the ventilator. How should the hours of mechanical ventilation be counted during the weaning process? 
Answer: All of the period of weaning is counted during the process of withdrawing the patient from ventilatory support. The duration includes the time the patient is on the ventilator, the weaning period, and ends when the patient is extubated and the mechanical ventilation is turned off (after the weaning period).
