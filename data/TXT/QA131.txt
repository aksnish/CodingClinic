Question: A patient who was diagnosed with spinal stenosis underwent L2-L3 posterolateral fusion, and repair of midline durotomy. In the body of the report, the provider documented that the durotomy was probably created from previous epidural injections. Is it appropriate to assign code G97.41, Accidental puncture or laceration of dura during a procedure, for the durotomy due to previous epidural injections? 
Answer: Assign code G96.11, Dural tear, for the durotomy secondary to previous epidural injections. In ICD10-CM, “Non-traumatic dural tear” is specifically indexed to code G96.11. Also, assign code Y84.8, Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure. In this case, the tear happened before the procedure, so it is not related to the procedure. Code G97.41 would have been assigned if the durotomy had occurred during the current operation.
