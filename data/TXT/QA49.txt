Question: The patient had previously undergone a Mitrofanoff procedure and now presents with Mitrofanoff channel polyps. The polyps were excised via cystourethroscope, and the surgeon documented “three fairly large polyps in the Mitrofanoff channel.” For the procedure, is the body part the appendix or the urinary system? What is the appropriate procedure code for excision of Mitrofanoff channel polyps? During a Mitrofanoff procedure, the appendix is used to create a conduit between the skin surface and the urinary bladder (neo-urethra). 
Answer: For the excision of the Mitrofanoff channel polyps, use the body part value “Urethra.” The appendiceal tissue is now functioning as urethra (neo-urethra). This is consistent with information previously published in Coding Clinic Second Quarter 2014, page 8. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 0TBD8ZZ
