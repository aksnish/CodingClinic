Question: What is the correct ICD-10-CM code for hyperplastic polyp of the descending colon, K63.5, Polyp of colon, or D12.4, Benign neoplasm of descending colon? The Alphabetic Index leads all colon polyps that specify location to category D12, Benign neoplasm of colon, rectum, anus and anal canal. Category D12 includes adenomatous polyps. Our understanding is that hyperplastic colon polyps are not neoplasms. 
Answer: Assign code K63.5, Polyp of colon, when the physician documents a hyperplastic colon polyp regardless of the location in the colon. ICD-10CM does not classify adenomatous polyps of the colon the same as hyperplastic polyps. Typically hyperplastic polyps of the colon are slow-growing and not pre-cancerous.
