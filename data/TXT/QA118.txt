Question: A patient admitted with severe sepsis is treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and is placed on mechanical ventilation for 40 hours. The documentation states that the patient has no underlying respiratory condition, and the respiratory decompensation is due to the severity of the sepsis. Which of the two procedures is the principal procedure, insertion of central venous catheter for IV antibiotic administration or mechanical ventilation? 
Answer: Sequence the code for the insertion of the central venous catheter as the principal procedure. Assign the mechanical ventilation code as an additional procedure. The catheter was inserted to administer IV antibiotics to treat the severe sepsis. The mechanical ventilation was required to treat the respiratory condition. The ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, Selection of Principal Procedure state, “Procedure performed for definitive treatment of both principal diagnosis and secondary diagnosis: Sequence procedure performed for definitive treatment most related to principal diagnosis as principal procedure.”
