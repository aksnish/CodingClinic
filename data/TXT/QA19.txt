Question: A nine-year-old girl with a diagnosis of vascular ring and double aortic arch presents for division of the ring. At surgery, a left thoracotomy was carried out, a small ligamentum arteriosus was identified, and divided with electrocautery. The left aortic arch was revealed and circumferentially dissected, ligated and divided. After division of the ligamentum, there was no apparent compression to the esophagus. What are the appropriate PCS codes for this procedure? 
Answer: The ICD-10-PCS does not provide a specific root operation or body part value for division of an aortic arch. Repair of the thoracic aorta is the closest available equivalent. Assign the following ICD-10PCS codes for the division of the vascular ring and division of left aortic arch: 0DN50ZZ
