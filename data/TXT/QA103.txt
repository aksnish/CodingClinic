Question: Coding Clinic for ICD-10-CM/PCS Fourth Quarter 2013, pages 126-127, provided advice about the creation of a percutaneous cutaneoperitoneal fistula. This advice is problematic. The root operation “Bypass” does not seem appropriate. The root operation “Insertion” appears to be a better choice. However there is no device value for peritoneal catheter in the ICD-10-PCS table under Insertion. How should the placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter (fistula) be coded? 
Answer: In the original question, the requester asked about creation of a cutaneoperitoneal fistula, which led to the root operation “Bypass.” However, upon further review by the Coding Clinic for ICD-10CM/PCS Editorial Advisory Board (EAB), the EAB determined that a procedure to place a peritoneal dialysis device is more appropriately classified as an insertion of infusion device. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS procedure code for placement of a peritoneal dialysis device: 0WHG33Z
