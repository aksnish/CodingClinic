Question: How is an open posterior colporrhaphy/rectocele repair coded in PCS? Should one or two codes be assigned for this procedure? 
Answer: In the context of a rectocele, colporrhaphy refers to the indirect result of repairing the laxity between the vagina and the rectum caused by the stretching of the pelvic fascia. The site of the repair procedure is the pelvic region fascia. A posterior colporrhaphy is the surgical intervention for repair of a rectocele. During the procedure, the rectum is pushed back into its normal position, and the support tissues between the back of the vagina and rectum are sutured to tighten the laxity in the fascia. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 0JQC0ZZ
