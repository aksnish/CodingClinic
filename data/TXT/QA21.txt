Question: A five-month-old with sagittal synostosis (craniosynostosis of the sagittal suture) presents for cranial vault reconstruction with orbital advancement. The frontal bone was removed, reshaped and then utilized to reconstruct the deformity of the skull. What is the appropriate root operation for the cranial vault reconstruction? 
Answer: Sagittal synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. The condition occurs when the sagittal suture closes prematurely, and restricts the transverse growth of the skull, causing abnormal skull shape and length. Cranial vault reconstruction also referred to as cranial vault reshaping remodels by repositioning the bones of the skull in order to enlarge the space within the vault. The intent of the surgery is to relieve pressure, allowing room for the brain to grow, and a more natural appearing head. During surgery, an incision is done over the top of the head from ear to ear; the skull is removed; bone is dissected from the brain; and cuts are made in the bones of the skull to reshape the head. The bone is then put back in place, and may be held together with absorbable plates or sutures. For the cranial vault reconstruction, assign the following ICD-10PCS code: 0NS00ZZ
