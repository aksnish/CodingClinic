Question: A patient diagnosed with open forearm fracture of both bones and closed distal radioulnar joint dislocation underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of the forearm bones, and manipulation of the dislocation. The provider documented that the wounds over the ulnar shaft were irrigated and debrided down to the bone. The ORIF and dislocation manipulation were then completed. Would it be appropriate to assign a code for the debridement in addition to the code for the ORIF and the manipulation? 
Answer: Query the physician as to the specific location and reason for the debridement (whether a separate excisional debridement versus cleaning of the open wound was done). If irrigation and debridement were done to clean the wound as part of the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), it would not be separately coded. For the ORIF of the fractures and manipulation of the dislocation, assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes: 0PSJ04Z
