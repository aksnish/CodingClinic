Question: The patient underwent ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis of the pulmonary artery (PA). What is the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code for ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis of the PA? Should the root operation “Insertion” be coded and is the ultrasound and accelerated thrombolysis procedure separately coded? 
Answer: Ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis uses specialized equipment to perform the procedure, but no device is left behind after the surgery. Delivery of ultrasonic waves via catheter is not considered insertion of a device in PCS terms. Therefore, the root operation “Insertion” is not appropriate, since “Insertion” is only coded when a device is left behind. Assign the appropriate code from ICD-10-PCS table 6A7, Extracorporeal therapies, physiological systems, ultrasound therapy, for the therapeutic ultrasound. Although this table is titled “extracorporeal therapies” and this type of ultrasound was not technically extracorporeal, these are the only therapeutic ultrasound codes available at this time. Additionally, assign the appropriate code from ICD10-PCS table 3E0, Administration, Physiological systems and anatomical regions, introduction, to identify infusion of the thrombolytic therapy. The pulmonary artery is classified as a central artery. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis of the pulmonary artery: 6A750Z7
