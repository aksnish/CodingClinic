Question: The patient presents with extensive hidradenitis suppurativa subcutaneous abscesses in her right and left breasts, axillary region, suprapubic space, and bilateral thighs. She underwent incision and loop drainage. First, the abscess cavities in the breasts were incised and opened and a vessel loop was placed and tunneled between abscess cavities through the surrounding areas. The vessel loops were then tunneled and connected the underlying abscess cavities for drainage. This procedure was repeated at multiple sites including the axillary region, suprapubic space, and thigh abscesses. In ICD-10-PCS, would “percutaneous or external” be the correct approach, and is the vessel loop classified as a “drainage device”? Additionally, what is the body part value for suprapubic space? 
Answer: The vessel loop is not classified as a drainage device in ICD-10-PCS. This is a surgical supply rather than a device, and the approach is coded as “open,” not percutaneous. The abscess cavities were incised and opened, so that the site of the procedure was exposed. The loop vessel was then used for tunneling between the cavities. The use of tunneling during a procedure does not always indicate the procedure was percutaneous. The body part for suprapubic space is “pelvic region.” Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the procedures performed: 0J9D0ZZ
