Question: What is the correct code assignment, when a patient is admitted for desensitization to a medication? For example, a patient with chronic respiratory conditions is currently symptomatic and recent sputum was found to be growing stenotrophomonas which is sensitive only to minocycline and Bactrim. Since the patient has experienced angioedema due to prior exposure to Bactrim, he was admitted for desensitization to the medication. 
Answer: There is no ICD-10-CM code to reflect an admission for desensitization. Assign the codes for the underlying condition (s) for which the medication requiring desensitization is to be given (in the example, assign the codes for the respiratory condition and the infectious agent that requires Bactrim) followed by status code Z88.2, Allergy status to sulfonamides status.
