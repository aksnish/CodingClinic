Question: The patient was diagnosed with acute liver injury as well as acute hepatitis, nonviral. Code S36.119, Unspecified injury of liver, does not seem to apply since there was no documentation of a traumatic injury to the liver. How should nontraumatic acute liver injury be coded? 
Answer: Code the exact nature of the liver problem, if known. If the etiology of the liver injury is not clearly documented, query the provider for clarification. For this example, assign code K72.00, Acute and subacute hepatic failure without coma, for non-viral acute hepatitis. In ICD-10-CM there is no Index entry for “acute hepatitis, nonviral.” However, the Alphabetic Index, under the term “Hepatitis” leads to code K75.9, Inflammatory liver disease, unspecified. Code K75.9 has an Excludes 1 note: acute or subacute hepatitis (K72.0-).
