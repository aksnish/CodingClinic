Question: The patient presents for surgical treatment of a necrotizing soft tissue infection of the left buttock. The provider documented the following in the operative note: “Using a sharp scalpel, I first connected the abscess sites and excised down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. The tissue was in the process of liquefying and was nonviable. The wound measured 8 cm wide by 4 cm long and 2.5 cm deep, and was extensively excised.” In this case, the physician does not explicitly document “excisional debridement,” however the documentation meets the root operation definition of “Excision.” What is the correct ICD-10-PCS code assignment for the procedure? 
Answer: Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for the excisional debridement of the buttock: 0JB90ZZ
