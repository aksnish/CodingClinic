Question: The physician documents “suspected sepsis” in a preterm newborn and treats the newborn with antibiotics for two days. The blood cultures are negative and sepsis is ruled out. The mother is without infectious disease. ICD-9-CM instructs the use of a code from category V29 Observation and evaluation of newborns and infants for suspected condition not found. What is the correct code in ICD-10-CM to capture a suspected infection in a newborn, ruled out, with a mother who does not have the infection? 
Answer: There is no code in ICD-10-CM that accurately reflects a suspected condition in a newborn, ruled out, when the mother does not have a related condition. Therefore, assign code P00.2, Newborn (suspected to be) affected by maternal infectious and parasitic diseases, when the physician has documented “suspected sepsis” in a newborn which is subsequently ruled out.
