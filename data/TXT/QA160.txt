Question: By definition, a second degree perineal laceration involves rupture or tearing of the perineal muscle(s). Would physician documentation stating, “Second degree perineal laceration repair” be sufficient to justify assigning an ICD-10-PCS repair code (0KQM0ZZ)? Or, is it required that the documentation specify “perineal muscle”? 
Answer: A second degree perineal laceration equates to laceration of the perineal muscle, so documentation of a second degree laceration is sufficient to code repair of perineal muscle. It is not required that the physician document “perineum muscle.”
