Question: A patient presents to our facility for evaluation of left hip and groin pain discomfort. Arthroscopy was performed which revealed left hip femoroacetabular impingement with symptomatic labral tear (sprain). What are the appropriate diagnostic code assignments for these conditions? We cannot find any Index entries to help us locate the appropriate code assignments. 
Answer: Assign code S73.192A, Other sprain of left hip, initial encounter, for the labral tear. Assign code M25.852, Other specified joint disorders, left hip, for the femoroacetabular impingement. ICD-10-CM’s Index cross-references “tear” with “sprain.” Subcategory S73.1 includes tear of the cartilage, joint or ligament of the hip. Sprains can include tears, and a tear is equivalent to a third degree sprain, which is a complete disruption. Additionally, ICD-10-CM does not provide a specific code for femoroacetabular impingement. Code M25.85- can be referenced in the Index under Disorder, joint specified type NEC, hip.
