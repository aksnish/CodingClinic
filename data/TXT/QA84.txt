Question: The patient is an 83-year-old male who presented with cervical myelopathy. He elected to proceed with decompressive cervical laminectomy to release the spinal cord. The surgeon performed an open total decompressive laminectomy of C3, C4, C5 and partial decompression of C6. Would it be appropriate to count each vertebra separately, (i.e., C3, C4, C5, and C6) and report four ICD-10-PCS codes? Or, is it appropriate to count each vertebral level decompressed, such as C3-4, C4-5, and C5C6? ICD-10- PCS Guideline B3.2 states, “During the same operative episode, multiple procedures are coded if: The same root operation is repeated at different body sites that are included in the same body part value.” 
Answer: The laminectomy procedure to release the spinal cord is coded only once because the cervical spinal cord is classified as a single body part. By convention, the vertebral level (C3, C4, and so on) is used to identify a specific area along the spinal cord, but each designation is not considered a separate and distinct body part anatomically. The current version of the ICD-10-PCS guideline B3.2b states, “During the same operative episode, multiple procedures are coded if: The same root operation is repeated at different body parts that are included in the same body part value.” The guideline uses two separate and distinct muscles in the upper leg as an example of the correct application of the guideline. The vertebral level designations of the cervical spinal cord do not constitute separate and distinct body parts anatomically, therefore the multiple procedures guideline B3.2b does not apply. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 00NW0ZZ
