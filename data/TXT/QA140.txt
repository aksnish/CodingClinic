Question: The patient was admitted for correction of left valgus and recurvatum deformities of the left distal femur. Osteotomy of the lateral, anterior and posterior cortex was performed. Plates and screws were placed in the fragments for stabilization. The position of the osteotomy, realignment and plate were felt to be excellent. Allograft chips and Grafton demineralized bone matrix putty were added before the wound was closed. How is the internal fixation reported for correction of the valgus deformity, with root operation repair or reposition? 
Answer: The appropriate root operation is “Reposition” for the realignment of the bone. The osteotomy is inherent to the repositioning of the bone and is not coded separately. The application of allograft bone to the site can be coded separately. Assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 0QSC04Z
