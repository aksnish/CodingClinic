Question: A patient with critical limb ischemia was seen for catheter-based treatment of a lesion in the left superficial femoral artery (SFA). During the procedure, an angled glidewire encountered significant difficulty, when attempting to enter the lumen of the distal SFA. At that point different crossing catheters and guidewires were utilized without success. Retrograde pedal access using angiogram guided road map was also unsuccessful in crossing the lesion. The procedure was aborted. How should the procedure be coded? 
Answer: Based on the documentation, only femoral angiography was performed. The inspection would be intrinsic to the angiogram. Therefore, assign the appropriate code for the angiogram.
