Question: The patient is admitted with an acute ischemic cerebral vascular accident, and is started on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion. Four hours after admission the patient suffers a second, massive infarction. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is successfully carried out and the patient required mechanical ventilation. He expires two days later without any improvement in his condition. Which of the two procedures is the principal procedure, infusion of thrombolytic or mechanical ventilation? 
Answer: Code the infusion of tPA as the principal procedure. Assign codes for the mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation as additional procedures. The ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, Selection of Principal Procedure state, “Procedure performed for definitive treatment of both principal diagnosis and secondary diagnosis: Sequence procedure performed for definitive treatment most related to principal diagnosis as principal procedure.” In this instance, the thrombolytic therapy was directed at the principal diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident, and therefore the tPA administration is selected as the principal procedure.
