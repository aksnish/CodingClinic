Question: If a physician documents “debridement of bone, fascia or muscle,” without specifying “excisional debridement,” can that be reported as excisional debridement? In order for the surgeon to get down into these areas, wouldn’t he or she need to excise/ cut? What code should we report for debridement performed on bone, muscle or fascia, if not specified as excisional? 
Answer: Coders cannot assume that the debridement of bone, fascia, or muscle is always excisional. For example, if a patient suffers a traumatic open wound and fascia, muscle, or bone is exposed, an excisional debridement may not be performed. ICD-10-PCS does not provide a default if the debridement is not specified as “excisional” or “nonexcisional.” In many cases, only nonexcisional debridement is required to clean the wound. Therefore, providers should specifically document the type of debridement. Clear and concise documentation is needed in order to accurately report excisional debridement. The link between good provider documentation and correct coding has always been emphasized in Coding Clinic. It is critical that hospitals work with their providers to ensure that the documentation used to support excisional debridement clearly describes the procedure. Although this may pose some challenges to the coding community, if the documentation is not clear or there is any question about the procedure, the provider should be queried for clarification. To avoid queries, which are frustrating and burdensome to both coders and providers, physicians should be encouraged to provide clear documentation at the point of care.
