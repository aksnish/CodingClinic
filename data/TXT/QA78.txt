Question: What is the correct ICD-10-CM code assignment for a patient who presents with an acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and develops post-infarctional angina when the patient also has atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD)? 
Answer: Assign code I21.4, Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, as the principal diagnosis. Codes I23.7, Postinfarctional angina, and I25.118, Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with other forms of angina pectoris, should be assigned as secondary diagnoses. In this case, the documentation indicates that the angina is postinfarctional, so code I23.7 is assigned. The presence of postinfarctional angina together with atherosclerosis is appropriately coded to I25.118, as it is another form of angina. Since angina is present, it would not be appropriate to use code I25.10, Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris.
