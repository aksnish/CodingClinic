Question: We are requesting that the Coding Clinic Editorial Advisory Board revisit advice published about non-Candida albicans sepsis. The Alphabetic Index under the term “Sepsis, candida,” directs to code B37.7, Candidal sepsis, as the code assignment is not Candida species specific. There are multiple species of Candida other than albicans, such as tropicalis, glabrata, etc. Please explain why code B48.8, Other specified mycoses, was assigned instead of B37.7. 
Answer: Coding Clinic, Second Quarter 2014, page 13, advised the assignment of code B48.8, Other specified mycoses, for sepsis due to non-Candida albicans. This code assignment was based on the health record documentation which was unclear as to the causal organism. Since the documentation is unclear, the physician should be queried for clarification. Non-candida albicans sepsis may refer to either sepsis of Candida, but not Albicans type or it may refer to an organism that is not of the Candida type at all. If Candida sepsis of any type is present, assign code B37.7, Candidal sepsis. If the causal organism is not Candida at all, assign code B48.8, Other specified mycoses.
