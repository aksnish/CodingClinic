Question: The above patient also underwent elevation, preparation, and transfer of radial forearm free flap to reconstruct the defect left by the orbital exenteration. Should the root operation for the radial forearm free flap procedure be reported as supplement or replacement? What is the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code assignment for this procedure? 
Answer: The appropriate root operation for the autograft used to reconstruct the face is “Replacement.” The root operation “Replacement” is defined as putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place and/or function of all or a portion of a body part. Harvesting of the graft should be coded separately, since the ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting (B3.9) state, “If an autograft is obtained from a different body part in order to complete the objective of the procedure, a separate procedure is coded.” For the procedures, assign ICD-10-PCS codes as follows: 0JR107Z
