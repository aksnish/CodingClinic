Question: A patient with right femoral occlusion and ischemic rest pain underwent bovine patch arterioplasty. In ICD-10-PCS, the root operation “Supplement” right femoral artery directs the coder to 04UK-. Although bovine patch appears to be graft tissue derived from animal, there is no device character for zooplastic at table 04U. What is the correct device character for bovine patch arterioplasty? 
Answer: “Zooplastic” is not a specific option at table 04U. Where the “zooplastic” device value is not available, when graft material is derived from a living or biological basis it is appropriate to use “nonautologous tissue substitute” as the device value. For the bovine patch arterioplasty, assign ICD-10-PCS code as follows: 04UK0KZ
