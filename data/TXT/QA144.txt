Question: A right skin-sparing mastectomy was performed due to the patientâ€™s history of left breast invasive lobular carcinoma. After superior, medial, inferior and lateral flaps were made, the breast was taken off using electrocautery. Is the skin-sparing mastectomy coded as a resection or excision of the breast? 
Answer: Even though the procedure spared the skin overlying the breast, nevertheless the entire breast was removed. While there is a separate body part value for nipple and breast, the mastectomy does not require two codes. This differs from the case total hysterectomy, where there was a special need to code cervix and uterus separately for tracking purposes. For the right skin-sparing mastectomy, assign the ICD-10PCS code as follows: 0HTT0ZZ
