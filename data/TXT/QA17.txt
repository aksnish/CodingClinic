He was readmitted for surgical treatment of subdural empyema, infection, and wound breakdown. At surgery, the previous incision was reopened, the skull hardware was removed, and the bone flap opened. Nonexcisional debridement was performed, removing all infectious material in the cranial wound and subdural and epidural areas. The flap was then re-secured, new plates and screws were placed and the wound closed. How should this procedure be coded? 
Answer: Assign the following ICD-10-PCS codes for the procedures performed: 00D20ZZ
