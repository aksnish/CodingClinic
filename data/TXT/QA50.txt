Question: A 19-year-old patient, status post ileal conduit urinary diversion surgery, developed tortuosity and kinking of the left ureter due to recurrent urinary tract infection. At surgery, the left ureter was detached. The surgeon straightened out the kinking and tortuosity and reimplanted the ureter at a different location. What is the correct root operation and body part for the ureter reimplantation? 
Answer: This patient is status post urinary diversion using intestinal tissue. The left ureter has been replaced with the ileum, which is now functioning as a ureter. During surgery, the kinking and tortuosity were straightened out, and the ureter was then reconnected at a different location. “Bypass” is the appropriate root operation because the ureter was rerouted, and a new connection was established. 0T170ZB
