Question: The patient presented with a subdural hematoma, which was successfully treated by placement of a subdural evacuation portal system (SEPS). During the placement of the drainage device, a burr hole was created and the SEPS drain bolt was then anchored in the bone. In ICD-10-PCS, what would be the approach value, “percutaneous” or “open?” 
Answer: The “percutaneous” approach is more appropriate since entry into the skull was done via puncture in order to reach the target area. An “open” approach is not reported since the surgical site was not exposed by cutting through the body layers. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for placement of the SEPS: 009430Z
