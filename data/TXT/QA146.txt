Question: A patient presents for treatment of a traumatic injury of the facial nerve with facial paralysis. At surgery, it was noted that a small branch of the right buccal nerve had been transected (cut). The surgeon reimplanted (buried) the distal end of the transected (cut) nerve into the zygomaticus major muscle. What is the appropriate ICD-10-PCS code for this surgery? 
Answer: In this case, the facial nerve was moved to another location; therefore “reposition” is the most appropriate root operation. For the reimplantation of the right facial nerve into the muscle, assign ICD-10PCS code as follows: 00SM0ZZ
