Question: A patient with cervical stenosis presented for laminoplasty of 
 evels C3-C7. The patient was l prepped for surgery and a midline posterior cervical incision was made. A drill was used to create a multi-segment osteotomy through the junction of the lamina and facet joint on the right side from levels C7 up to C3. On the left side, a junction of the facet and lamina at each level was scored with the drill from C7 to C3 to create a stress riser in the bone. The laminae were then cracked back to expand the spinal canal space. A 12-mm allograft strut graft was selected and shaped, then attached to a graft plate. The allograft and plate construct was then placed between the cut edge of the lamina on the right and the swinging door and then anchored with screws. This procedure was performed at each level C3 through C7. What are the appropriate root operation, and body system, for laminoplasty?
