Question: ICD-10-CM provides two codes for capturing gestational age of 42 weeks or more: Z3A.42, 42 weeks of gestation of pregnancy, and Z3A.49, Greater than 42 weeks of gestation of pregnancy. Clarification is needed when assigning these codes for 42 weeks of gestation or more. When is it appropriate to assign code Z3A.42, 42 weeks gestation of pregnancy? Would it be assigned only if the patient is exactly 42 0/7 weeks? Or should this code be assigned whenever the patient is less than 43 weeks? For example, the patient was admitted at 42 1/7 weeks gestation for induction of labor. The patient delivered at 42 2/7 weeks. What code is assigned to appropriately capture the weeks of gestation? Answer:
 Assign code Z3A.42, 42 weeks gestation of pregnancy. Any number of days in week 42 up to 43 weeks is coded as Z3A.42. For 43 weeks or more of pregnancy assign code Z3A.49, Greater than 42 weeks of gestation of pregnancy. Question: During a routine physical examination of the newborn, the provider noted a possible systolic ejection murmur, and recommended further workup post discharge. In ICD-10-CM, under the terms murmur, systolic the coder is directed to endocarditis. What is the appropriate code assignment for a “possible systolic ejection murmur” that occurs in the perinatal period?
