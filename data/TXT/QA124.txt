Question: The patient experienced an obstetrical periurethral laceration during delivery. What is the correct body part for suture repair of an obstetrical periurethral laceration? ICD-10-PCS coding guideline B4.1 states that when a body part site is prefixed with “peri” the procedure should be coded to the body part named. Therefore, when coding a repair of a periurethral laceration, should we report repair of “urethra?” How should this case be coded? 
Answer: Assign code O71.82, Other specified trauma to perineum and vulva, for an obstetric periurethral tear. In this case, the urethra is not being repaired. The anatomic region describing the surface area being repaired is the vulva. The Index under “Tear, periurethral tissue, obstetrical trauma,” leads to code O71.82. The instructional note under code O71.5 further instructs the coder that code O71.82 is excluded. For the repair, assign the ICD-10-PCS code as follows: 0UQMXZZ
