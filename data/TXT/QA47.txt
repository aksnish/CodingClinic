Question: A patient presented to the electrophysiology laboratory for removal of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) generator and lead. An incision beneath the clavicle was reopened and was carried down to the ICD pocket. The generator was disconnected from the leads and removed. The lead was then removed with retention of access in the subclavian vein using a wire. What approach value should we use for the removal of the cardiac lead, percutaneous or open? 
Answer: Although the site where the lead was attached to the generator was visualized directly, the cardiac lead was removed percutaneously using a guidewire. In addition, the body part value of the code specifies the heart, and the heart was not visualized directly, so the appropriate approach value is percutaneous. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code: 02PA3MZ
