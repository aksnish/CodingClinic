Question: A patient with retinal detachment of the left eye underwent surgical repair. Provider documentation states that a core vitrectomy was done, followed by 360 degrees peripheral vitreous base dissection, and thorough vitrectomy for 360 degrees. Once the retinal tear was identified, partial air-fluid exchange was performed, photocoagulation/endolaser was placed surrounding the retinal tear, and air was replaced with 20% sulfur hexafluoride gas. What is/are the appropriate root operation(s) for the vitrectomy and air replacement with 20% sulfur hexafluoride gas? 
Answer: In this case, the root operation is “Excision,” because the entire vitreous is not removed during a vitrectomy. Do not code the instillation of oil, air or fluid into the vitreous following vitrectomy, because it is integral to the procedure. The substance instilled functions like packing inside the eye: it holds the retina and other structures in the proper position. The oil, air or fluid does not replace or supplement the vitreous. The body secretes fluid that over time fills the void left by the vitrectomy. Assign the following ICD-10-PCS code for the vitrectomy: 08B53ZZ
